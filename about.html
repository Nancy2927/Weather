          <p> Global warming, deforestation, environment degradation has altered the natural processes of climate change to such an extent that the conventional seasonâ€™s time periods have changed drastically. The extremely scorching summers and chilling winters have not only affected the mankind but also tampered the existence of other living beings.

            Maharashtra and Karnataka are becoming a problem to the livelihood of people. In such situations, it has become essentially important to keep a track of the changing weather conditions by maintaining records and monitoring the changes to avoid or at least reduce the damage being caused.
            This project aims at maintaining a database of the weather conditions of certain places, where the record consists of the temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. Also, we maintain the sunrise and the sunset timings for more user interest.Simple instructions and engaging interface of the project make it easy for the user to operate it and enhances the user friendliness of the project.
